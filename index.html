            <h2>What is Texas Hold'em?</h2>
            <p> Texas Hold'em is the most popular and widely played poker variant in the world, featured in both casual home games and high-stakes tournaments like the World Series of Poker. 
                The game is a blend of strategy, psychology, and calculated risk-taking, making it appealing to both beginners and seasoned players. 
                Each player is dealt two private cards (hole cards), while five community cards are placed face-up on the table in three stages: 
                the flop (three cards), the turn (one card), and the river (one final card). The goal is to make the best possible five-card hand using any combination of hole and community cards. 
                Betting rounds occur between each stage, allowing players to fold, call, raise, or bluff their way to victory. 
                Mastering Texas Holdâ€™em requires understanding hand probabilities, reading opponents, and knowing when to play aggressively or fold conservatively.
                Its combination of skill and luck keeps the game exciting, and with the right strategy, players can consistently improve their odds of winning.</p>
            <p>From casual games with friends to high-stakes tournaments like the World Series of Poker, Texas Hold'em has captivated millions worldwide.</p>
